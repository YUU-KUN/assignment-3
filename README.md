# Greeter Component â€“ Vue 3

A lightweight, embeddable Vue 3 component that renders a button and displays a customizable message in the browser console when clicked. This component is designed to be inserted into **any third-party app** via a simple `<script>` tag.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ“¦ Self-contained and framework-agnostic once built
- ðŸŽ¯ Configurable via `Greeter.init(selector, { message })`
- ðŸ’¬ Message injected from host app
- ðŸ”„ Built with Vue 3 and supports Virtual DOM diffing
- âœ… Safe to embed in existing sites or apps

## ðŸ§  Why Use the Virtual DOM?

Vue 3 uses a Virtual DOM under the hood to:

- Efficiently update only the changed parts of the DOM
- Keep rendering predictable and declarative
- Enable component-level encapsulation with reactive state

Even though this component is simple (only one button), we **chose to keep using Vue's Virtual DOM** because:

- It keeps the structure declarative and clean
- It allows future expansion (like adding animations, slots, or dynamic styling) with minimal overhead
- The performance cost is negligible for such a small use case

In short, we chose Virtual DOM **because it's built-in, efficient, and scalable** for future needs.
